Posy
=================

This plugin contains a generator to create a unix access control scheme.  Each user
belongs in a group (via memberships), and groups have permissions to resources (models)
and controllers.  Resource permissions always take precendence over controller
permissions.  Also contained in this plugin is the userstamp plugin, which will
stamp user id's on records that have created_by and updated_by fields.

To use the generator with the default names, run:
  ./script/generate posy

You can also specify what names you want to use for users, groups, memberships,
permissions, and sessions.  Check out the USAGE file in the generators directory for 
more information.

After using the generator, edit the config/access_control.yml file and add the names
of the controllers and models that you want users to have access to.  Also, add:

  prepend_before_filter :login_required

to any controller you wish to have access control over.  By default, an admin user is
created in the migration with a password of 'test'.  Make sure you change the password.

Enjoi!
