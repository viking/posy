UnixAccessControl
=================

This plugin contains a generator to create a unix access control scheme.  Each user
belongs in a group (via memberships), and groups have permissions to resources (models)
and controllers.  Resource permissions always take precendence over controller
permissions.  Also contained in this plugin is the userstamp plugin, which will
stamp user id's on records that have created_by and updated_by fields.

To use the generator with the default names, run:
  ./script/generate unix_access_control

You can also specify what names you want to use for users, groups, memberships,
permissions, and sessions.  Check out the USAGE file in the generators directory for 
more information.

After using the generator, edit the config/access_control.yml file and add the names
of the controllers that you want users to have access to.  Also, add:

  before_filter :login_required

to any controller you wish to have access control over.  To make an admin user, open
up console and create a user, then add them to the group named 'admin' like so:
  
  u = User.create(:login => 'foo', email => 'foo@bar.com', :password => 'foobar',
                  :password_confirmation => 'foobar')
  u.groups << Group.find_by_name('admin')

Enjoi!
